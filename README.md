# Introduction

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Sklearn's API for their unsupervised clustering algorithms. I used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min) dataset from Kaggle.com that contains information for the first 10-minutes of gameplay for Diamond Ranked games in League of Legends.

After cleaning the data, I trained 8 different clustering algorithms to see which one works the fastest and which one fits the data the best.

If you would like to read the notebook, [this](https://github.com/knolasco/LoL_Revisited/blob/main/Clustering%20League%20of%20Legends.ipynb) is the jupyter notebook and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/kevinnolasco/clustering-league-of-legends-games/notebook) is the kaggle notebook.

Thank you for your time.
